# Recify
In this project I have used the Spoonacular API and Room, a database object mapping library. This app includes basic functionality like login and register with the access of searching the recipes,adding the favourite recipes to users favourite list.The app also provides the functionality to have step by step instruction to cook the recipe which user likes and also shows the similar recipes.
